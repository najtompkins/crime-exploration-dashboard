# LA_CrimeData_Dashboard
### Project #3: Full Stack Dashboard


### Project Proposal
#### Team Members: Martin Bedino, David Pinsky, Lois Stetson, Nathan-Andrew Tompkins

### City of Los Angeles Crime:

- We propose an analysis of the City of Los Angelos and the crime reported there to determine different variables and how they relate to crime rates based on age, types of weapons, locations of division police stations, etc... 
- There are a few points we plan to explore using interactive visualization:
  - Determine where crimes fall in relation to the police stations within the several LA divisions in. Map chart interactive visualization
  - What is the most used weapon
  - What are the distributions of the victim's ages?
  - How does time of year and time of day affects the amount of crime?
