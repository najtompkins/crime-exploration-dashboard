### Crime in the City of Los Angeles:

- This full-stack dashboard development and analysis proposal will explore the city of Los Angelos and the numerous crimes reported between Jan. 2020 and Sep. 2023 to determine different variables and how they relate to crime rates based on age, types of weapons, locations of division police stations, etc... 
- Visual Considerations:
  - Determine where crimes fall in relation to the police stations within the several LA divisions in. Map chart interactive visualization
  - What are the distributions of the victim's ages?
  - What are the distributions of the victim's sexes?
